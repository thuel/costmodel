    v.

    Dijkstra's algorithm is only guaranteed to work correctly when all
    edge lengths are positive. This code does not verify this property
    for all edges (only the edges examined until the end vertex is
    reached), but will correctly compute shortest paths even for some
    graphs with negative edges, and will raise an exception if it
    discovers that a negative edge has caused it to make a mistake.
